# Python Unitest
Tests are very essential in development. It is a very good practice to adopt the Test Driven Development(TDD)
model of development. 

TDD is an approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.

## Unittest
Unittest is a python package which helps to carry out tests on codes. It is advised that developments write the 
tests before run and fail before writing the code and then re-run the test and ensure it passes.
