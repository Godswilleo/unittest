# Python Unitest
Tests are very essential in development. It is a very good practice to adopt the Test Driven Development(TDD)
model of development. 

TDD is an approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.

## Unittest
Unittest is a python package which helps to carry out tests on codes. It is advised that developments write the 
tests before run and fail before writing the code and then re-run the test and ensure it passes.

## How to use this test script
- Ensure that python is installed on your machine 
- clone this repo into your machine
- In the terminal, go to the directory of the cloned repo
- type __python -m unittest [test_name]__

Test name will be either __test_circle__ or __test_employee__ to this the __circle__ and __employee__ codes respectively
